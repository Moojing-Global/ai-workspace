# Remote and Video Verification

## What is Remote and Video Verification?

EMAS eKYC offers remote video verification for complex cases requiring human review. When automated identity verification encounters edge cases—unusual documents, poor image quality, or high-risk transactions—businesses need a way to resolve these situations without losing legitimate customers or compromising security. Remote video verification provides this resolution path.

A trained agent conducts a live video session with the customer, guiding them through identity document verification, liveness checks, and security questions. The customer shows their ID on camera, the agent compares it with their live appearance, and the system cross-checks information against databases. The entire process takes place remotely, requiring no branch visit.

## What Problems Does It Solve?

**Automated Verification Cannot Handle All Edge Cases**. While automated systems excel at standard documents and scenarios, they struggle with unusual situations: damaged documents, rare ID types, technical image quality issues, or documents from countries with limited system training. Rejecting these applications means losing legitimate customers. Remote video verification provides a resolution path that combines automation efficiency with human judgment.

**High-Value Transactions Need Additional Assurance**. For premium accounts, large loan amounts, or significant withdrawals, businesses need more rigorous verification than automated systems alone provide. Human agents can detect inconsistencies, assess behavior, and ask clarifying questions that automated systems cannot. This additional layer reduces fraud risk on high-exposure transactions.

**Regulatory Requirements May Mandate Human Oversight**. Some jurisdictions or transaction types require human involvement in identity verification for compliance. Financial institutions serving certain markets or offering specific products must demonstrate human review occurred. Video verification provides documented proof of human oversight while maintaining digital convenience.

**Physical Branches Are Costly and Limit Reach**. Traditional in-person verification requires expensive branch networks and restricts service to customers who can visit physical locations. This limits geographic expansion and excludes customers in remote areas. Remote video verification delivers the security of in-person verification without the infrastructure costs.

## How Businesses Use It

### Financial Services - Tiered Verification
A digital bank uses automated verification for standard accounts but requires video verification for business accounts, accounts with initial deposits over $50,000, or any account requesting credit facilities. This tiered approach protects the bank from sophisticated fraud on high-value relationships while keeping the process frictionless for most customers. When automated verification rejects an application due to a technical issue—glare on the ID photo, for example—the system offers the customer a video verification option rather than forcing them to restart.

### Cryptocurrency Platforms - High-Value Withdrawals
A crypto exchange triggers video verification when a user attempts to withdraw more than $25,000 or when behavioral analysis flags suspicious activity—new device, unusual location, or atypical trading patterns. The agent confirms the account owner's identity before releasing the funds, preventing account takeover fraud that automated systems might miss. For users who consistently pass verification without issues, the system learns and may reduce video verification frequency.

### Lending and Credit - Loan Threshold Verification
Loan providers implement video verification for applications above certain thresholds—$10,000 personal loans, business loans, or mortgages. The agent verifies identity and discusses the application, building confidence in the customer's legitimacy while providing a personal touch that enhances the customer relationship. This approach reduces fraud losses on significant financial commitments without requiring branch visits.

### Telecommunications - Compliance Fallback
Mobile operators facing mandatory SIM registration use automated verification as the primary method but offer video verification for customers in areas with poor connectivity (who submit low-quality photos) or those without compatible devices. This ensures compliance without excluding customers who cannot complete automated verification. Existing customer service teams handle these calls, requiring minimal additional infrastructure.

### Insurance - High-Value Claims
Insurance companies use video verification when processing high-value claims to confirm the policyholder's identity before releasing payments. This catches fraudulent claims involving stolen identities or falsified documents, protecting the company from substantial losses.

## Real-World Examples

### Digital Bank: Premium Account Growth
**Challenge**: A Southeast Asian digital bank wanted to offer premium accounts with higher credit limits but needed more rigorous verification than their automated system provided. They were concerned about fraud risk on high-exposure accounts but didn't want to build expensive physical branches.

**Solution**: Implemented video verification for premium accounts while keeping standard accounts fully automated. Customers applying for premium accounts completed automated verification first, then scheduled a brief video call with a verification specialist.

**Results**: 156% increase in premium account signups within six months. 94% reduction in premium account fraud compared to automated-only verification. 4.7/5.0 customer satisfaction scores for premium onboarding. 8-minute average verification session time. Successfully verified customers in 12 countries from a single operations center. 40% lower operational costs than competitors with branch networks.

### Cryptocurrency Exchange: Withdrawal Fraud Prevention
**Challenge**: After suffering $3.2 million in account takeover fraud, an exchange needed better protection for high-value withdrawals. Automated systems couldn't detect sophisticated account takeover attempts where fraudsters gained access to legitimate accounts through phishing or credential theft.

**Solution**: Added mandatory video verification for withdrawals over $25,000 or when automated systems flagged suspicious activity. During the video call, agents confirmed identity using government ID and asked security questions about account history.

**Results**: 97% reduction in account takeover fraud within one year. $8.6 million in prevented fraudulent withdrawals. 97% of verification calls completed within 10 minutes. 23-point increase in Net Promoter Score as customers recognized the security benefits. 41% reduction in customer support inquiries about account security.

## FAQ

**Q: When should businesses use video verification instead of automated verification?**
A: Use video verification strategically for specific scenarios: automated verification flags an issue requiring human judgment, transaction value exceeds your risk threshold, regulatory requirements mandate human oversight, customer explicitly requests to speak with someone, or behavioral analysis indicates elevated risk. Process standard, low-risk transactions through automation.

**Q: How long does a typical video verification session take?**
A: Most video verification sessions complete in 5-10 minutes. Duration depends on the complexity of the case and business requirements. Simple identity confirmation takes 3-5 minutes, while more thorough reviews for high-value accounts may take 10-15 minutes.

**Q: What technology do customers need for video verification?**
A: Customers need a device with a camera (smartphone, tablet, or computer), stable internet connection, and a modern web browser or mobile app. The solution should support all major browsers and operating systems to minimize customer friction. Some providers offer appointment scheduling to help customers prepare.

**Q: How do you ensure video sessions are secure and compliant?**
A: Sessions are encrypted end-to-end during transmission and stored securely afterward. Businesses can configure retention policies compliant with GDPR, PDPA, and regional regulations. Complete audit trails document what occurred during each session. Agents are trained on privacy requirements and data handling procedures.

**Q: What training do agents need to conduct video verification?**
A: Agents need training on verification procedures, document authentication, fraud detection techniques, customer service, and cultural sensitivity. Training typically takes 1-2 weeks initially, with ongoing education as fraud tactics evolve and document types expand. Many businesses leverage existing customer service staff who already possess customer interaction skills.

**Q: Can video verification integrate with automated verification workflows?**
A: Yes, video verification integrates seamlessly with automated identity verification. When automated checks flag an issue or business rules trigger human review, the system routes cases to video verification. Agents access the customer's submitted documents, verification results, and database check outcomes during the call, providing full context for their decision.

**Q: What are the cost implications compared to automated verification?**
A: Video verification costs more per transaction than automation (typically $3-8 vs $0.50-2.00 for automated checks) due to agent time. However, it's significantly cheaper than physical branches (70-90% cost reduction) and prevents fraud losses that far exceed the verification cost. Use it strategically for high-value or complex cases while automating standard transactions to optimize costs.
