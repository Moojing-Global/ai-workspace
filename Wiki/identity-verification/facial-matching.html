    <h2>What is Facial Matching?</h2>

    <p>OkayFace is EMAS eKYC's facial matching component. It compares the live selfie captured during onboarding with the photo on a government-issued ID to confirm both images belong to the same person.</p>

    <p>While OkayDoc confirms a document is authentic and OkayLive verifies the user is real, OkayFace answers: "Is this the right person?" This prevents identity theft when fraudsters possess genuine stolen documents. OkayFace achieves 99.50% accuracy with a 0.000001 false match rate, with processing occurring in real-time for instant verification.</p>

    <h2>What Problems Does It Solve?</h2>

    <article>
      <h3>Stolen Documents Enable Fraud</h3>
      <p>Fraudsters obtain genuine ID documents through theft, dark web purchases, or social engineering. Even when businesses verify a document is authentic, they cannot confirm the person presenting it is the legitimate owner. This gap allows criminals to open fraudulent accounts and commit financial crimes.</p>
    </article>

    <article>
      <h3>Manual Photo Comparison Is Unreliable</h3>
      <p>Training staff to compare selfies with ID photos creates bottlenecks and introduces human error. People vary in their ability to recognize faces, especially across different ethnicities or when photos are taken years apart. Manual verification lacks consistency—the same comparison may yield different results depending on who performs the review.</p>
    </article>

    <article>
      <h3>Security Must Balance with User Experience</h3>
      <p>Traditional verification methods require customers to visit physical branches or wait days for manual review, causing application abandonment rates as high as 30%. Companies need instant verification that is both accurate and seamless for legitimate users.</p>
    </article>

    <article>
      <h3>Regulatory Compliance Requires Documentation</h3>
      <p>Financial institutions, telecommunications companies, and other regulated industries must demonstrate they have verified customer identities according to KYC and AML requirements. Manual processes create audit challenges and inconsistent documentation.</p>

    <h2>How Businesses Use It</h2>

    <article>
      <h3>Financial Services and Digital Banking</h3>
      <p>Banks and fintech companies integrate OkayFace into mobile apps to verify customer identities during account opening. After a customer uploads their ID document and captures a selfie, OkayFace instantly confirms the match, enabling same-day account activation. This eliminates branch visits and allows digital banks to onboard customers 24/7 while maintaining regulatory compliance.</p>
    </article>

    <article>
      <h3>Cryptocurrency Exchanges</h3>
      <p>Crypto platforms use OkayFace to meet KYC regulations while processing thousands of verification requests daily. When users register accounts or increase transaction limits, OkayFace verifies the person matches their submitted identification. This prevents bad actors from using stolen documents to create accounts for money laundering.</p>
    </article>

    <article>
      <h3>Telecommunications and SIM Registration</h3>
      <p>Mobile network operators leverage OkayFace at retail locations and online channels to verify customer identities during SIM card registration.

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <dl>
      <dt>How accurate is facial matching compared to manual review?</dt>
      <dd>OkayFace achieves 99.50% accuracy with a 0.000001 false match rate, significantly outperforming manual review which varies by individual and conditions. Manual comparison accuracy drops below 80% when photos are taken years apart or across different ethnicities, while OkayFace maintains consistent accuracy regardless of these factors.</dd>

      <dt>How long does the facial matching process take?</dt>
      <dd>Facial matching completes in under 1 second in real-time. The entire verification workflow—including ID capture, liveness check, and facial matching—typically takes less than 2 minutes for customers to complete. There is no waiting period for manual review.</dd>

      <dt>Can facial matching work with older ID photos?</dt>
      <dd>Yes, OkayFace is designed to match faces even when ID photos are several years old. The AI algorithms account for natural aging, changes in hairstyle, facial hair, and weight fluctuations. It successfully matches photos taken up to 10+ years apart while maintaining high accuracy.</dd>

      <dt>What happens if someone's appearance has changed significantly?</dt>
      <dd>OkayFace uses advanced algorithms that focus on permanent facial features that don't change with age, weight, or appearance modifications. For extreme cases where legitimate users are rejected, businesses can implement secondary verification flows or manual review escalation paths.</dd>

      <dt>Is facial matching compliant with privacy regulations?</dt>
      <dd>Yes, OkayFace is compliant with GDPR, PDPA, and other regional privacy regulations. Biometric data is processed securely with encryption, and businesses maintain full control over data retention policies. The system provides audit logs for regulatory reporting and doesn't store biometric templates without explicit consent.</dd>

      <dt>How does it prevent someone from using a photo of the ID holder?</dt>
      <dd>OkayFace works in conjunction with OkayLive (liveness detection) which ensures the selfie comes from a real person, not a printed photo, video, or deepfake. This multi-layer approach prevents presentation attacks where fraudsters try to use photos or videos of the legitimate ID holder.</dd>

      <dt>Can it integrate with existing onboarding systems?</dt>
      <dd>Yes, OkayFace offers REST APIs, mobile SDKs (iOS/Android), and webhooks for seamless integration with existing customer onboarding workflows. Most businesses integrate within 2-4 weeks. The solution works with various ID verification platforms, CRM systems, and mobile applications.</dd>
