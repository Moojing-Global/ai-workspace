    <h2>What is ID Verification?</h2>

    <p>OkayDoc is EMAS eKYC's document authentication component that verifies whether identity documents are genuine, legitimate, and unaltered. Using patented AI algorithms and image analysis, OkayDoc examines ID cards, passports, and driver's licenses for approximately 20 different security features—including holograms, ghost images, microprints, watermarks, and UV elements—to determine authenticity in seconds.</p>

    <p>Unlike manual inspection that relies on human judgment and reference guides, OkayDoc uses machine learning models trained on millions of documents to detect even sophisticated forgeries. It includes anti-spoofing capabilities to identify photographed documents, screen displays, and color-printed copies, as well as anti-tampering detection to flag altered or modified documents. OkayDoc enables businesses to prevent identity fraud, comply with KYC regulations, and protect themselves from financial losses.</p>

    <h2>What Problems Does It Solve?</h2>

    <article>
      <h3>Fraudulent Documents Are Increasingly Sophisticated</h3>
      <p>Modern identity fraud has evolved beyond simple photocopies. Criminal organizations now produce fake IDs with sophisticated printing techniques, replica holograms, and security features that look genuine to the untrained eye. In 2024, financial institutions lost over $5.8 billion globally to identity fraud, with fraudulent documents being a primary attack vector. Traditional manual verification cannot keep pace with these forgery techniques.</p>

    <article>
      <h3>Manual Document Inspection Doesn't Scale</h3>
      <p>Banks, fintech companies, and other regulated businesses traditionally employed specialized staff to manually inspect ID documents during customer onboarding. This approach has critical limitations: it's slow, expensive, only available during business hours, and requires extensive training. Human inspectors cannot consistently detect sophisticated forgeries, especially when processing hundreds of documents daily.</p>
    </article>

    <article>
      <h3>Digital Onboarding Creates New Vulnerability</h3>
      <p>The shift to digital customer onboarding has created new opportunities for fraudsters. Without physical document inspection, criminals can submit photographed fake IDs, screen-captured images, or color-printed copies. These "presentation attacks" are increasingly common, with some platforms reporting that 15-20% of submitted documents are spoofed or tampered with.</p>
    </article>

    <article>
      <h3>Regulatory Compliance Requirements Are Mandatory</h3>
      <p>Financial services, telecommunications, and other regulated industries must comply with KYC and AML regulations that require verifying customer identity documents. Regulatory authorities across ASEAN are increasing enforcement, with significant fines for businesses that fail to properly authenticate customer IDs. Manual verification processes struggle to maintain consistent standards and documentation.</p>

    <h2>Real-World Examples</h2>

    <article>
      <h3>Fintech Company Prevents $3.2M in Fraud</h3>
      <p><strong>Challenge</strong>: A digital lending platform was experiencing rapid growth but facing increasing fraud attempts. Over a 6-month period, the company approved 247 fraudulent loan applications totaling $3.2 million using fake or altered ID documents. Their manual document review process—staffed by 6 verification specialists—was unable to detect sophisticated forgeries, especially during high-volume periods when reviewers processed 80-100 documents daily.</p>

      <p><strong>Solution</strong>: The platform integrated OkayDoc into their loan application workflow. Every submitted ID document now goes through automated authentication checking approximately 20 security features, including hologram detection, microprint analysis, and tamper detection. Suspicious documents are automatically rejected, while verified documents proceed to immediate loan decisioning.</p>

      <p><strong>Results</strong>: Detected and blocked 1,847 fraudulent applications in first 6 months. Prevented an estimated $2.8 million in fraud losses. Reduced document verification time from 8 minutes to 3 seconds. Eliminated 5 of 6 verification specialist positions, saving $275,000 annually. Increased loan approval speed from 24 hours to 5 minutes for verified applicants.</p>

      <h3>Regional Bank Stops Synthetic Identity Fraud</h3>
      <p><strong>Challenge</strong>: A traditional bank expanding into digital services was experiencing a new type of fraud: synthetic identities created with altered or fake documents. Fraudsters were combining real and fake information to create identities that passed basic checks. Over 18 months, the bank lost $1.8 million to synthetic identity fraud where criminals opened accounts, built credit, and disappeared after maxing out credit lines.</p>

      <p><strong>Solution</strong>: The bank deployed OkayDoc for all digital account opening channels. The system's tamper detection algorithms specifically identify signs of document alteration, including photo substitution, text modification, and composite documents created from multiple sources.</p>

      <p><strong>Results</strong>: Detected 892 altered or composite documents in first 12 months. Prevented an estimated $2.4 million in synthetic identity fraud. Identified fraud patterns leading to law enforcement investigation. Reduced time to detect fraud from 6-12 months to immediate detection at application. Achieved return on investment in 4 months through fraud prevention alone.</p>

    <h2>FAQ</h2>

    <dl>
      <dt>How does OkayDoc detect fake documents that look genuine?</dt>
      <dd>OkayDoc analyzes approximately 20 security features that criminal forgers cannot easily replicate: holograms, ghost images, microprints, UV elements, watermarks, security threads, and more. The AI models are trained on millions of genuine and fraudulent documents, learning patterns that human inspectors might miss. It also detects presentation attacks like photographed or printed copies.</dd>

      <dt>What happens if a legitimate document is rejected?</dt>
      <dd>OkayDoc maintains false positive rates below 1%, meaning legitimate documents are rarely rejected. When rejection occurs, businesses can configure manual review processes or allow customers to recapture images. The system provides specific feedback on why verification failed, helping users correct issues like glare or poor image quality.</dd>

      <dt>Can it verify documents from any country?</dt>
      <dd>OkayDoc supports ID documents from 195+ countries, with deep expertise in ASEAN markets including Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. The system is continuously updated as governments issue new document versions and security features.</dd>

      <dt>How does it prevent screen capture and photo attacks?</dt>
      <dd>OkayDoc's anti-spoofing technology detects moiré patterns from digital screens, paper textures from printed photos, and image quality inconsistencies that indicate photographed documents. It analyzes pixel-level characteristics that differ between genuine document captures and presentation attacks.</dd>

      <dt>What is the accuracy rate for fraud detection?</dt>
      <dd>OkayDoc achieves fraud detection accuracy above 99%, with false positive rates below 1%. Accuracy varies slightly by document type and image quality, but the system consistently outperforms manual human inspection across all metrics.</dd>

      <dt>How quickly does verification complete?</dt>
      <dd>Document authentication completes in 2-5 seconds from upload. This includes document type detection, security feature analysis, spoofing checks, and tamper detection. Results are returned in real-time, enabling instant onboarding decisions.</dd>

      <dt>Can businesses customize verification rules?</dt>
      <dd>Yes, businesses can configure verification thresholds, decide which security checks are mandatory, and set different rules for different customer segments or transaction types. High-risk scenarios can require stricter verification, while low-risk cases can use faster processing with lower thresholds.</dd>
