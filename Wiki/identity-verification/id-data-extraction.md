# ID Data Extraction

## What is ID Data Extraction?

OkayID is EMAS eKYC's data extraction component that automates customer information capture from identity documents. The module uses optical character recognition (OCR) technology, NFC scanning, and chip readers to extract data from passports, driver's licenses, and national ID cards.

OkayID first identifies the document type—passport, driving license, or national ID—then automatically extracts relevant information into the appropriate fields. This eliminates manual data entry while maintaining accuracy standards that exceed human performance. As the first step in the digital identity verification journey, OkayID enables businesses to scale customer onboarding without scaling their workforce.

## What Problems Does It Solve?

**Manual Data Entry Is Slow and Error-Prone**. Traditional customer onboarding requires staff to manually type information from ID documents into digital systems. This process is time-consuming and expensive, requiring dedicated personnel during business hours. Human error rates can reach 5-10% for manual data entry, leading to customer frustration, compliance issues, and costly corrections.

**Customer Expectations Have Changed**. Today's customers expect instant digital experiences. They don't want to spend 10-15 minutes manually typing personal information from their ID card. Each additional step in the onboarding process increases abandonment rates—studies show application completion rates drop by 20-30% when manual data entry is required.

**Scaling Manual Verification Is Impossible**. As businesses grow or experience seasonal spikes, manual data entry becomes a bottleneck. Hiring and training new staff for data entry takes weeks and involves significant overhead costs. During peak periods, backlogs can stretch from hours to days, causing customer complaints and reputational damage.

**Limited Service Hours Restrict Growth**. Manual processes only work during business hours when staff are available. This means customers in different time zones or those who prefer to register in the evening cannot complete their applications. Limiting onboarding to 9-5 Monday-Friday creates a competitive disadvantage and leaves revenue on the table.

## How Businesses Use It

### Digital Banking and Fintech
Banks and financial technology companies integrate OkayID into mobile applications and web portals to streamline account opening. When a customer applies for a checking account, credit card, or loan, they take a photo of their ID card with their smartphone. OkayID extracts name, date of birth, ID number, address, and other required fields, populating the application automatically. This reduces account opening time from 15-20 minutes to under 2 minutes.

### Telecommunications and Mobile Operators
Mobile network operators use OkayID at retail locations and online to comply with SIM card registration regulations. When customers purchase a new SIM card, staff or customers scan the ID document, and OkayID captures all required information for regulatory compliance. This eliminates manual typing errors that could result in regulatory violations while speeding up activation from 10 minutes to under 1 minute per customer.

### E-Commerce and Marketplace Platforms
Online marketplaces require merchant verification before granting seller accounts. OkayID enables these platforms to verify seller identities instantly during registration. When new merchants apply to sell on the platform, they upload their ID document, and OkayID extracts business owner information for verification purposes.

### Insurance Companies
Insurance providers use OkayID during policy applications and claims processing. When customers apply for life, health, or auto insurance, they scan their ID rather than filling out lengthy forms. The system automatically populates policyholder information, reducing application time and eliminating transcription errors.

### Healthcare and Telehealth Services
Telehealth platforms and medical facilities use OkayID to register patients quickly and accurately. When patients sign up for virtual care services or visit a new healthcare provider, they scan their ID to automatically populate registration forms. This ensures patient records have accurate information while allowing medical staff to focus on care.

## Real-World Examples

### Digital Bank Eliminates Onboarding Bottleneck
**Challenge**: A new digital bank launched with aggressive customer acquisition goals but found manual data entry was creating a massive bottleneck. Eight full-time staff members were processing 200-300 account applications daily, but error rates were high, and processing times averaged 24-48 hours. During promotional campaigns, backlogs extended to 5 days, causing 35% of applicants to abandon the process.

**Solution**: The bank integrated OkayID into their mobile app and web application. Customers now photograph their ID card, and OkayID automatically extracts all required information—name, date of birth, ID number, address, and nationality—populating the application form instantly.

**Results**: Application completion time dropped from 48 hours to 3 minutes. Customer abandonment rate decreased from 35% to 8%. Eliminated all 8 data entry positions, saving $180,000 annually. Error rates dropped from 7% to 0.3%, and successfully processed 2,500 applications during peak promotion without backlogs.

### Insurance Provider Transforms Policy Applications
**Challenge**: An insurance company was losing potential customers due to lengthy application forms requiring 25+ fields of personal information. Internal analysis showed that 42% of applicants who started an insurance quote abandoned the application before completion. The manual data entry requirement was identified as the primary friction point, especially for mobile users.

**Solution**: The insurer added OkayID to their quote and application process. Customers could now simply scan their ID card, automatically populating name, date of birth, address, and ID number fields. This reduced manual input requirements by 80%.

**Results**: Application completion rate increased from 58% to 86%. Mobile application completion specifically jumped from 41% to 79%. Average application time reduced from 12 minutes to 4 minutes. New policy sales increased by 33% without additional marketing spend, and customer complaints about application process dropped by 68%.
