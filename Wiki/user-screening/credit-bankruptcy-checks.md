# Credit Score and Bankruptcy Checks

## What is Credit Score and Bankruptcy Checks?

EMAS eKYC offers credit and bankruptcy screening through partnerships with regional and international credit bureaus to help businesses assess the financial credibility of customers during onboarding. This automated screening evaluates an individual's creditworthiness and financial stability by checking credit scores, payment history, and bankruptcy records.

By instantly querying credit bureau databases and bankruptcy registries, businesses can make informed decisions about extending credit, setting payment terms, or approving high-value transactions. This screening happens in seconds as part of the customer verification process, eliminating the need for manual credit checks while protecting businesses from default risk and bad debt.

## What Problems Does It Solve?

**Credit Defaults Drain Revenue and Profitability**. Without access to credit history, businesses offering loans, device financing, or payment plans face significant default risk. Companies approve customers who cannot or will not repay their obligations, leading to bad debt write-offs, expensive collection efforts, and reduced profitability. Traditional credit checks through separate vendors add days to the approval process.

**Manual Credit Assessment Is Slow and Inconsistent**. Credit decisions based on manual document review or subjective judgment create bottlenecks and introduce human error. Different staff members may reach different conclusions about the same applicant, leading to inconsistent approval standards. This creates compliance risks, damages customer relationships through unfair treatment, and slows business operations.

**Bankruptcy and Financial Distress Go Undetected**. Customers currently in bankruptcy or with recent insolvency can appear creditworthy during basic verification. Without checking bankruptcy registries, businesses unknowingly extend credit to individuals legally unable to repay, leading to immediate defaults and legal complications. Bankruptcy filings also indicate potential fraud risk in other transactions.

**Pricing and Limits Don't Match Actual Risk**. Offering the same credit limits and pricing to all customers ignores significant risk variations. High-risk customers receive more credit than they should, while low-risk customers face unnecessary restrictions. This misalignment leads to higher default rates and lost revenue from underserved creditworthy customers.

**Credit Decisions Delay Customer Onboarding**. Traditional credit bureau queries require separate systems, manual intervention, or third-party vendors that add hours or days to approval processes. Customers abandon applications during long wait times, especially for instant-approval products like digital wallets or device financing. Businesses lose qualified customers to competitors with faster onboarding.

## How Businesses Use It

### Digital Lending and BNPL Platforms
Buy-now-pay-later services and digital lenders integrate credit checks into instant approval workflows. When customers apply for loans or split-payment options, the system automatically queries credit bureaus and checks bankruptcy records in real-time. Credit scores determine approval decisions, loan amounts, and interest rates instantly. This enables true instant lending while maintaining acceptable default rates.

### Telecommunications Companies
Mobile operators offering device financing or postpaid plans screen customers to determine appropriate credit limits and deposit requirements. Before approving an expensive smartphone on a payment plan, carriers check credit scores and bankruptcy history. Customers with strong credit receive higher limits and waived deposits, while those with poor credit pay upfront or receive lower-value devices.

### Insurance Providers
Insurance companies use credit and bankruptcy checks during policy application assessment to evaluate financial stability and predict claims behavior. Applicants with poor credit scores or bankruptcy filings may receive different premium pricing or coverage terms, as financial distress correlates with higher claims rates. This helps insurers accurately price risk and reduce policy defaults.

### Real Estate and Property Management
Property management companies screen rental applicants to assess ability to pay rent consistently. Before approving lease applications, landlords check credit scores and bankruptcy records to identify financially unstable applicants. This protects property owners from non-paying tenants and costly eviction processes.

### E-Commerce and Retail
Online retailers offering payment plans or account credit use these checks to set appropriate credit limits and payment terms. Buy-now-pay-later options at checkout trigger real-time credit screening that determines approval and maximum purchase amounts. Customers with excellent credit receive higher limits, while those with poor history get lower limits or must pay upfront.

## Real-World Examples

### Digital Lending Platform Reduces Default Rate
**Challenge**: A Southeast Asian digital lending platform was experiencing a 12% default rate on personal loans. Their basic identity verification couldn't detect customers with poor credit history or existing bankruptcies. Manual credit checks were too slow for their instant loan approval model, and they lacked access to regional credit bureaus across multiple ASEAN markets.

**Solution**: Implemented credit score assessment and bankruptcy screening through partnerships with regional credit bureaus. The platform integrated multiple credit data providers through a single API, enabling real-time risk scoring during the loan application process. Applicants with credit scores below thresholds received automatic rejections or reduced loan amounts.

**Results**: Default rate decreased from 12% to 3.5% within six months. Loan approval process reduced from 24 hours to 5 minutes. Prevented $4.2M in potential bad debt in first year while maintaining 87% approval rate for qualified customers. Expanded to 3 additional countries using same credit screening infrastructure.

### Telecom Carrier Optimizes Device Financing
**Challenge**: A major telecommunications provider offered smartphone financing to customers, but 18% of financed devices resulted in defaults where customers stopped making monthly payments. The carrier was requiring all customers to pay 30% deposits regardless of credit history, which reduced sales to creditworthy customers while still experiencing high default rates.

**Solution**: Integrated credit score and bankruptcy checks into the point-of-sale device financing workflow. Customers with excellent credit received zero-deposit financing and higher device limits. Those with good credit paid 10-20% deposits. Customers with poor credit or recent bankruptcies were required to pay 50% upfront or purchase devices outright.

**Results**: Default rate on device financing dropped from 18% to 6%. Device financing sales increased 34% among creditworthy customers due to zero-deposit offers. Prevented $8.7M in device financing defaults in first year. Customer satisfaction with financing options increased 41%. Processed 250,000+ credit checks with 98% completed in under 3 seconds.
