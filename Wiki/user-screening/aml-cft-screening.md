# AML/CFT Screening

## What is AML/CFT Screening?

EMAS eKYC offers AML/CFT screening to check customers against sanctions lists, PEP databases, and watchlists through partnerships with international risk intelligence providers. This automated compliance screening helps businesses identify individuals and entities involved in money laundering, terrorist financing, or subject to international sanctions before establishing business relationships.

By instantly querying global sanctions databases, politically exposed persons (PEP) registries, adverse media sources, and financial crime watchlists, businesses can meet regulatory Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Financing of Terrorism (CFT) requirements while protecting themselves from legal exposure and reputational damage. This screening integrates seamlessly into customer onboarding workflows, providing compliance decisions in seconds.

## What Problems Does It Solve?

**Regulatory Penalties from Inadequate Due Diligence Are Devastating**. Financial institutions and regulated businesses face strict AML/CFT requirements mandating thorough customer screening. Failure to properly screen customers against sanctions lists and PEP databases results in millions in fines, criminal prosecution of executives, and revocation of operating licenses. A single compliance failure can destroy years of business building.

**Manual Sanctions Screening Is Impossible at Scale**. Checking every customer against hundreds of international sanctions lists, PEP databases, and watchlists manually is impractical for businesses onboarding dozens or thousands of customers. Staff must query multiple databases, interpret results across different languages and naming conventions, and make compliance judgments. This creates massive bottlenecks and introduces human error.

**Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Expose Businesses to Criminal Liability**. Unknowingly facilitating financial crimes makes businesses legally liable even when they had no intent to break the law. Companies that fail to screen customers may find themselves used as conduits for money laundering, terrorist financing, or sanctions evasion. This results in criminal investigations, asset freezes, and prosecution.

**Reputational Damage from Association with Criminals Is Irreversible**. Being identified as the platform that enabled sanctioned entities or money launderers to operate destroys brand trust permanently. News coverage of compliance failures leads to customer exodus, partner relationship termination, and permanent market credibility loss. Recovering from reputational damage costs far more than preventing it.

**Politically Exposed Persons Introduce Corruption Risk**. PEPs hold prominent public positions that make them targets for corruption and bribery. Without identifying PEP status during onboarding, businesses cannot apply enhanced due diligence requirements. This exposes companies to corruption schemes, regulatory penalties for inadequate PEP screening, and reputational damage from association with corrupt officials.

## How Businesses Use It

### Digital Banks and Fintech
Financial services companies integrate AML/CFT screening into account opening workflows to screen customers against sanctions lists, PEP databases, and adverse media automatically. When customers apply for accounts or attempt transactions, the system queries 40+ international watchlists and provides instant compliance decisions. Matches trigger enhanced due diligence workflows while clear customers receive immediate approval.

### Cryptocurrency Exchanges
Crypto platforms face intense regulatory scrutiny around AML compliance and must screen every user against global sanctions lists and terrorist financing databases. AML/CFT screening checks customer identities during registration and monitors existing users for emerging risks. When regulators audit compliance, platforms demonstrate thorough screening of all users with complete documentation.

### Payment Service Providers
Money transfer services, remittance platforms, and payment processors screen both senders and receivers of funds to prevent sanctions violations and terrorist financing. Before processing international transfers, systems check both parties against sanctions lists and watchlists. Flagged transactions are blocked automatically, preventing regulatory violations.

### Real Estate and High-Value Transactions
Property developers and luxury goods retailers use AML/CFT screening to verify source of funds and prevent money laundering through high-value purchases. Before accepting cash purchases of real estate or expensive items, businesses screen buyers against PEP databases and adverse media to identify corruption risks.

### Gaming and Gambling Platforms
Online casinos and betting platforms screen customers to prevent use of gambling for money laundering purposes. Regulators require gaming operators to screen customers against sanctions lists and apply enhanced monitoring to PEPs. AML/CFT screening identifies high-risk users who require additional transaction monitoring.

## Real-World Examples

### Cryptocurrency Exchange Avoids Regulatory Shutdown
**Challenge**: A cryptocurrency trading platform was onboarding 5,000+ new users monthly but lacked robust AML screening. They manually checked major sanctions lists, which took hours per user and created verification backlogs exceeding 48 hours. A regulatory audit revealed they had failed to detect 15 users on international sanctions lists and had not screened for PEPs at all. The regulator threatened license revocation and $15M in fines.

**Solution**: Deployed comprehensive AML/CFT screening with automated queries against 40+ international watchlists, sanctions databases, and PEP registries. The system screened every new user during registration and implemented continuous monitoring to flag existing customers who appeared on updated lists.

**Results**: Passed follow-up regulatory audit with zero compliance violations. Blocked 347 high-risk applicants in first month, including 23 on sanctions lists. Identified 89 existing users who were PEPs requiring enhanced monitoring. Reduced KYC processing time from 4 hours to 30 seconds. Avoided estimated $15M in regulatory fines and license revocation.

### Digital Bank Prevents Money Laundering Network
**Challenge**: A digital-only bank discovered they had unknowingly onboarded 12 individuals connected to an international money laundering network. These customers had clean backgrounds when initially screened but had been added to adverse media databases and financial crime watchlists after account opening. The bank's manual screening process only checked customers at onboarding. Regulators fined the bank $8M.

**Solution**: Implemented AML/CFT screening with continuous monitoring capabilities. The system re-screened all existing customers daily against updated watchlists and adverse media sources. When customers appeared on new sanctions lists or in negative news coverage, compliance teams received immediate alerts for investigation.

**Results**: Identified and closed accounts of all 12 money laundering network members within 48 hours. Detected 234 existing customers with emerging risk flags in first quarter. Prevented estimated $22M in money laundering activity. Reduced regulatory compliance violations to zero while automating screening of 500,000+ existing customers daily.

## FAQ

A: Screening completes in under 5 seconds for most customers, with results returned instantly. Complex cases with multiple potential matches may take up to 30 seconds for comprehensive analysis. This allows real-time compliance decisions during customer onboarding without delays.

**Q: What happens when there's a positive match?**
A: Positive matches are categorized by risk level. High-risk matches (sanctions, terrorist lists) trigger automatic rejection or transaction blocking. Medium-risk matches (PEPs, adverse media) activate enhanced due diligence workflows requiring manual review. The system provides match confidence scores and detailed information for investigation.

The system returns confidence scores for each match, allowing businesses to set appropriate thresholds. Most implementations achieve 95%+ true positive rates while minimizing false positives that disrupt legitimate customers.

**Q: Can we customize screening rules for different customer types?**
A: Yes, businesses can configure risk-based screening rules.
