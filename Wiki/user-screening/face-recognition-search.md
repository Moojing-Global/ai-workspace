# Face Recognition Search

## What is Face Recognition Search?

OkayFace Search is EMAS eKYC's facial recognition search tool that enables businesses to search their entire customer database using facial biometrics. Unlike traditional database searches that require exact name matches or ID numbers, OkayFace Search identifies individuals by comparing a captured face image against all stored customer profiles, returning potential matches with confidence scores.

This capability transforms how businesses detect duplicate accounts, identify fraud networks, and verify customer identities across their systems. Whether investigating suspicious activity, preventing multiple account creation, or finding customers who have changed their names, OkayFace Search provides instant answers that would be impossible through conventional database queries.

Built on the same AI-powered facial recognition technology as OkayFace verification, the search function delivers 99.5% accuracy while processing queries against millions of records in seconds.

## What Problems Does It Solve?

**Duplicate Accounts Drain Resources and Enable Fraud**. Fraudsters create multiple accounts using different names, email addresses, and phone numbers to exploit promotional offers, bypass bans, or build synthetic fraud networks. Traditional database searches cannot detect these duplicates because they rely on matching names or ID numbers that fraudsters easily change. Businesses waste money on duplicate promotional bonuses and struggle to enforce terms of service.

**Identity Changes Make Customers Impossible to Find**. Customers who legally change their names after marriage, divorce, or personal preference become invisible in traditional name-based database searches. When these customers contact support, apply for new services, or attempt to recover accounts, staff cannot locate their records. This creates poor customer experiences, duplicated accounts, and compliance issues.

**Manual Fraud Investigation Is Slow and Incomplete**. When fraud investigators suspect a customer is using multiple accounts or is connected to known fraudsters, they must manually review hundreds of customer photos looking for visual matches. This process takes hours or days, introduces human error from fatigue or bias, and often misses sophisticated fraud networks.

**Account Takeover Victims Cannot Prove Their Identity**. When customers report their accounts have been taken over and credentials changed, support teams struggle to verify the legitimate owner. Traditional recovery methods rely on remembering passwords, answering security questions, or accessing email accounts—all controlled by the attacker. Without ability to biometrically search the database, businesses cannot definitively identify the real customer.

**Fraud Networks Operate Undetected Across Multiple Identities**. Organized fraud rings create networks of seemingly unrelated accounts using different personal information. Traditional fraud detection cannot connect these accounts because names, addresses, and contact information differ. Fraud losses accumulate across many accounts before patterns emerge, by which time criminals have already profited and disappeared.

## How Businesses Use It

### Financial Services and Digital Banking
Banks use OkayFace Search to prevent customers from opening multiple accounts to exploit promotional bonuses and credit offers. During new account applications, systems search the customer database for facial matches to existing accounts. When matches are found, banks can enforce rules limiting promotional offers to one per person or investigate potential fraud.

### E-Commerce and Marketplace Platforms
Online marketplaces deploy OkayFace Search to prevent sellers banned for fraud or policy violations from creating new merchant accounts under different names. When new sellers register, platforms search for facial matches against banned user databases. Matches trigger enhanced verification or automatic rejection, preventing bad actors from circumventing enforcement actions.

### Gaming and Entertainment Platforms
Gaming companies use facial search to enforce account bans and prevent cheaters from returning under new identities. When players create accounts, systems check against databases of banned users. Matches indicate ban evasion attempts, allowing platforms to maintain fair play environments. This also prevents users from creating multiple accounts to exploit referral bonuses.

### Insurance Companies
Insurers search facial databases during claims processing to detect fraud rings where multiple people file false claims using different identities. By comparing claimant photos across all policies and claims, investigators identify individuals involved in multiple suspicious claims under various names. This uncovers organized fraud networks invisible to name-based searches.

### Telecommunications
Mobile operators use facial search to prevent customers from obtaining multiple SIM cards under different names for use in SMS spam operations or fraud schemes. During SIM registration, systems search for facial matches to existing customers. Unusual patterns of one person registering many SIM cards trigger investigation.

## Real-World Examples

### E-Commerce Marketplace Stops Promotional Fraud Ring
**Challenge**: A Southeast Asian e-commerce platform offered $50 sign-up bonuses to new users, attracting massive promotional abuse. Fraud investigators suspected organized groups were creating hundreds of accounts to claim bonuses repeatedly, but traditional detection based on names, addresses, and payment methods failed because fraudsters varied all these details. Manual photo review of 50,000+ customer accounts was impossible.

**Solution**: Implemented OkayFace Search to scan the customer database for facial duplicates. The system identified all accounts sharing the same facial biometrics, revealing the scope of duplicate account creation. During new sign-ups, real-time facial searches flagged accounts where the same person already held an account.

**Results**: Identified 847 individuals operating 4,200+ duplicate accounts (average 5 accounts per person). Prevented $3.2M in fraudulent promotional bonuses in first 6 months. Blocked 92% of duplicate account creation attempts during registration. Uncovered 12 organized fraud rings operating coordinated multi-account schemes. Reduced promotional fraud from 34% to 3% of sign-up bonuses.

### Digital Bank Recovers Accounts for Name-Changed Customers
**Challenge**: A digital bank received 200+ monthly customer service requests from users who couldn't access accounts after legal name changes (marriage, divorce, personal choice). Traditional database searches required exact name matches or ID numbers, which changed after name changes. Support staff spent hours trying different name variations and often couldn't locate accounts.

**Solution**: Deployed OkayFace Search to enable support staff to locate customers by facial recognition. When customers contacted support, staff requested a live selfie and searched the database for facial matches. The system returned all accounts associated with that face, regardless of name changes, along with historical customer data.

**Results**: Resolved 97% of name-change account recovery requests within 5 minutes. Reduced average resolution time from 4 hours to 5 minutes. Prevented creation of 2,400+ unnecessary duplicate accounts in first year. Customer satisfaction with account recovery increased from 34% to 91%. Support staff handled 3x more recovery requests with same team size.
