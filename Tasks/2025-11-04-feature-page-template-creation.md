# Task: Feature Page Template Creation

**Date**: 2025-11-04
**Category**: Documentation
**Status**: Completed

---

## Overview

Created a standardized template and comprehensive guidelines for writing business-focused, educational wiki pages for Innov8tif's features and modules.

---

## Problem Statement

The existing wiki pages were inconsistent and too technical, focusing on implementation details rather than business value. There was no standardized structure for creating educational content about features, leading to:

- Inconsistent page structure across different features
- Content that was too technical for business stakeholders
- Lack of clear guidelines for what to include and how to write it
- Difficulty communicating product value to non-technical audiences

---

## Solution

### Created Documentation Structure

1. **Feature Page Template SOP** (`SOP/feature-page-template.md`)
   - Comprehensive guide with detailed instructions for each section
   - Writing guidelines and best practices
   - Content quality checklist
   - Examples for each section

2. **Blank Template** (`SOP/_feature-page-blank-template.md`)
   - Quick-start copy-paste template
   - Ready to fill in without guidelines text
   - Preserves proper markdown structure

3. **SOP Directory Index** (`SOP/README.md`)
   - Created comprehensive index of all SOPs
   - Added categorization and quick reference table
   - Included maintenance guidelines

### Template Structure

The template follows a 5-section outline focused on education and business value:

1. **What is [Technology]?**
   - Brief definition (2-3 sentences)
   - Plain language, no jargon

2. **What Problems Does It Solve?**
   - Business pain points
   - Specific, relatable scenarios
   - Impact framing (time, cost, risk)

3. **How Businesses Use It**
   - Practical applications
   - Industry-specific examples
   - High-level workflows

4. **Key Benefits**
   - Measurable outcomes
   - Organized by category
   - Specific metrics

5. **Real-World Examples**
   - Case studies with before/after
   - Concrete metrics and outcomes
   - Multi-industry examples

6. **Getting Started** (Optional)
   - Clear next steps
   - Call-to-action

### Key Principles

- **Business-focused**: Emphasize value over technical details
- **Educational**: Help readers understand when and why to use it
- **Concrete**: Use specific metrics, examples, and scenarios
- **Accessible**: Avoid jargon, write for non-technical audiences
- **Consistent**: Standardized structure across all features

## Lessons Learned

1. **Structure matters**: A clear outline makes content creation much faster
2. **Examples are crucial**: Showing what "good" looks like is more effective than just describing it
3. **Business focus requires discipline**: It's easy to slip into technical details; guidelines help maintain focus
4. **Reusability is valuable**: Having both detailed guidelines and a blank template serves different needs
