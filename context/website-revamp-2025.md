# Website Revamp Project 2025

**Status**: In Progress
**Last Updated**: 2025-11-04
**Project Focus**: EMAS eKYC Product Branding

---

## Project Overview

The company is undergoing a major website revamp in 2025 with a strategic shift in branding focus from **Innov8tif** (company brand) to **EMAS eKYC** (product brand). This represents a significant repositioning to emphasize the product's value and capabilities rather than corporate identity.

### Key Strategic Decision
**Product-First Branding**: The website will prominently feature EMAS eKYC as the primary brand, with Innov8tif taking a secondary role as the company behind the product.

## Homepage Structure & Content Strategy

Based on the current work-in-progress design, the homepage follows this structure:

### 1. Hero Section
**Headline**: "Everything You Need to Verify & Qualify Users"

**Value Proposition**:
- EMAS eKYC is an all-in-one solution for seamless user onboarding experience
- Helping businesses enhance compliance and security before fraud ever takes place
- Promises top capabilities with fast, secure and accurate verification

**Call-to-Actions**:
- "Get Components" (Primary)
- "Get Started" (Secondary)

**Visual Element**: Hero image/video demonstrating deepfake detection technology with reference image comparison

**Trust Indicators**: Logo bar showing "Trusted by Industry Leaders" featuring client/partner logos including:
- Various financial institutions
- Technology companies
- Enterprise clients
- Regional partners

### 2. How We Help Businesses

Four core value propositions presented as numbered sections:

#### 01: Reduce Fraud Risks
Stop synthetic identities and imposter fraud before they reach your system. Preventing fraudulent sign-ups saves time, money and ultimately builds trust with your real customers.

#### 02: Accelerate Onboarding
Onboard genuine users quickly with rapid document review, liveness check, and video calls. Real customers don't wait in long lines—they expect instant, frictionless experiences.

#### 03: Scale Without Overhead
Scale your verification process without hiring more staff. Fully-digital verification lets you handle spikes in demand, 24/7, without adding operational overhead.

#### 04: Meet Compliance Standards
Meet ever-changing standards with ease. Stay updated with changing KYC, AML, and data protection rules without the constant scramble to retrain teams.

**Visual Treatment**: Each section includes relevant imagery/icons representing the benefit
