## What Problems Does It Solve?

Manual verification is slow and expensive. Traditional ID verification requires trained staff to manually inspect documents, creating bottlenecks during onboarding. This process can take hours or days, leading to abandoned applications and lost revenue.

Fraudulent documents are increasingly sophisticated. Modern fraudsters use advanced techniques that look genuine to the human eye. Without specialized tools, businesses face identity fraud, financial losses, and regulatory penalties.

Compliance requirements are complex and evolving. Regulations require identity verification, but keeping up with changing requirements across jurisdictions is resource-intensive and error-prone.

Customer experience suffers from delays. Customers expect instant digital experiences. Lengthy verification creates friction, damages brand perception, and drives potential customers to competitors.
