# DOCS

We keep all important company docs in the current codebase and keep updating them. Structure:

- Context: Details regarding the context of the project, usually involving company profiles, product, customer list info, etc.
- SOP: Best practices of execute certain tasks (e.g. how to add a component, how to connext to PagesCMS, etc.)
- Tasks: Tasks performed on the codebase, which will reference, and be referenced by documents within the SOP directory.
- README.md: an index of all the documentations we have so people know what & where to look for things

We should always update the directories above after we implement certain feature, to make sure it fully reflects the up to date information.

**Before you plan any implementation, always read the `.agent/README.md` first to get context.**
